# Folder structure explanation

- api/: This directory contains the code related to interacting with the website's API. The client.py file could contain functions or classes responsible for making API requests, handling authentication, and processing responses. The models.py file can define data models representing the structure of API responses.

- tests/: Unit tests for your project. Writing tests is crucial to ensure the reliability and stability of your code. Separate test files for different components (e.g., API client, data models) can make it easier to manage and run tests.

- utils/: Utility functions that are used across the project. Keeping common functions in a separate directory promotes code reusability.

- .gitignore: This file specifies which files or directories should be ignored by version control systems (like Git). Common entries include virtual environments, compiled files, and sensitive information.

- LICENSE: Your project's license file. Choose a license that aligns with your project goals.

- README.md: Documentation for your project. This file should contain information about the project, how to install it, usage examples, and any other relevant information.

- requirements.txt: A file listing all the dependencies required for your project. This makes it easy for others to recreate your development environment.

- setup.py: A script for installing your project as a package. This is useful if you want others to be able to install your project using pip.

- main.py: An entry point for your application or an example usage. This file can serve as a starting point for users who want to understand how to use your API.
